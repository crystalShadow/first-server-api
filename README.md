# first-server-api
a simple first server
an api stands for application programming interface.
api's does the work of connectivity.
It will be more clear with example.
When you open somw websites,it will tell you to sign in with google.
how that happens is google provides that code in google-api-console to use it in your website or any webite.
Those bunch of codes are actually api's.
Another example:
We dont always visit the official website of any cinema theatre.we generally book it with third-party websites such as "book my show" or "paytm".
so api's link it with official websites.The main work of api is linking website/app with database.
api's are very necessary for maintenance of any website or an app.
