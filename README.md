# first-server-api
a simple first server
an api stands for application programming interface.
api's does the work of connectivity.
It will be more clear with example.
When you open some websites,it will tell you to sign in with google.
how that happens is google provides that code in google-api-console to use it in your website or any webite.
Those bunch of codes are actually api's.
Another example:
We dont always visit the official website of any cinema theatre.we generally book it with third-party websites such as "book my show" or "paytm".
so api's link it with official websites.The main work of api is linking website/app with database.
api's are very necessary for maintenance of any website or an app.
Open cmd in windows and install packages by "npm install --save".
Then type in cmd "node index.js" to see whether it is running successfully or not.if it is running successfully it will show the output"running successfully on port 3000"
Now go to your chrome browser and type in"localhost:3000" to see the magic:)
